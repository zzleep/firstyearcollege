I'll be uploading more of this when I get the time to get my files.

Basically, this is my college code dump that will go on for 3 more years and I would like to share my journey as I proceed with my course in IT.

Be sure to check the PDFs if you ever get confused on what I'm trying to make using the MP (Machine Problem) programs.
